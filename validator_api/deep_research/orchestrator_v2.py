                            1. Requires deep research (complex topics, factual research, analysis of multiple sources, or needs verification through web search)
                            2. Can be answered directly (simple questions, greetings, opinions, or well-known facts that do not require research)

                            # Definitions
                            ## Deep research questions typically:
                            - Seek factual information that may require up-to-date or verified data (e.g., prices, event times, current status)
                            - Involve complex topics with nuance, such as technical processes, system design, or multi-step methodologies
                            - Request detailed breakdowns, plans, or analysis grounded in domain-specific knowledge (e.g., engineering, AI development)
                            - Require synthesis of information from multiple or external sources
                            - Involve comparing different perspectives, approaches, or technologies
                            - Would reasonably benefit from web search, expert resources, or tool use to provide a comprehensive answer

                            ## Questions NOT suitable for deep research include:
                            - Simple greetings or conversational remarks (e.g., "How are you?", "Hello")
                            - Basic opinions that don't require factual grounding or research
                            - Simple, well-known facts that don't need verification (e.g., "The sky is blue")
                            - Requests for purely imaginative content like poems, stories, or fictional narratives
                            - Personal questions about the AI assistant (e.g., "What's your favorite color?")

                    1. Break down the problem into clear analytical steps
                    2. Focus on what information needs to be gathered and analyzed

                    4. Consider what tools might be needed at each step
                    5. DO NOT include report writing or summarization in the steps - that will be handled in the final answer

                    Format your response as a numbered list where each item follows this structure:
                    1. [Analysis/Research Task]: What needs to be investigated or analyzed
                    - Information needed: What specific data or insights we need to gather

                    - Validation: How we'll verify the information is accurate and complete

                    Your todo list should focus purely on the steps needed to find and validate the answer, not on presenting it.
